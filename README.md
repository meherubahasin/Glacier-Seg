# Glacier-Seg: Lightweight Hybrid CNN–Transformer–Mamba Architecture for Glacier Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data processing scripts, and model implementations for **Glacier-Seg**, a compact and high-performing hybrid architecture designed for glacier segmentation using multi-modal remote sensing data (SAR, optical, DEM). The project aims to achieve accurate, efficient, and near real-time glacier mapping for both satellite and drone imagery.

Key features include:
- Multi-modal data handling (SAR, optical, DEM)
- Geometric, radiometric, and photometric data augmentation
- CNN, Transformer, and hybrid model architectures
- Evaluation with IoU, Dice, Precision, Recall, Pixel Accuracy, and AUC-ROC
- Lightweight design for edge deployment
